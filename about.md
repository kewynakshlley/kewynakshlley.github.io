title: About me
---

I am currently an Information Systems student at UFPB (Universidade Federal da Para√≠ba), and my only experience in the industry are projects that I've participated at the university. I'm very fascinated by fields like Infrastructure, Distributed Systems and by the OpenSource philosophy.

I have in mind that the most effective way to improve is facing problems bigger than myself.
