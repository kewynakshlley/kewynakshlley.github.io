title: About me
---

I am currently an Information Systems student at UFPB (Universidade Federal da Para√≠ba), and my only experience in the industry are projects within the University. Passionate about learning, I'm very fascinated by fields like Infrastructure, Distributed Systems and by the OpenSource philosophy.

My goal as a professional is to solve problems bigger than myself. I believe all the problems can be solved through the scientific method.
