title: About me

Hello, there! My name is Kewyn and I am a DevOps Engineer currently working for @Virtus. In this role I've been building and maintaining a MLOps environment using tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker and Fluxcd on top of Amazon Web Services (AWS). In my spare time I always try to learn things related to infrastructure, distributed systems and the open source philosophy. 

I have in mind that the most effective way to improve is facing problems bigger than myself.
