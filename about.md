title: About me
---

I am a DevOps Engineer currently working for @Virtus, where I've been using tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Docker, Fluxcd and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In my spare time I always try to lerrn things related to infrastructure, distributed systems and the open source philosophy. 

I have in mind that the most effective way to improve is facing problems bigger than myself.
