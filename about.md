Hello, there! My name is Kewyn, and I am a Software Engineer. I consider myself very passionate about this field, it's like every time that I am working on a task some new knowledge is unlocked, and I'm always expanding, it's very exciting. Also, In my spare time, I'm always learning things related to infrastructure, distributed systems  and systems design, applying everything absorbed on personal  and professional projects.

I have in mind that the most effective way to improve is facing problems bigger than myself.
