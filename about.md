title: About me
---

I am Software Developer graduated in Information Systems at UFPB (Federal University of Para√≠ba). I'm very fascinated by fields like Infrastructure, Distributed Systems and by the OpenSource philosophy.  

I have in mind that the most effective way to improve is facing problems bigger than myself.
